# Data-transmission
This project was created for the students of the technological university of VÃ©lizy, in France. Its purpose is to combine data transmission, mathematics and coding.

In this project, we will have the task of transmitting data in the form of audio using an external sound card. We will use the Python libraries matplotlib for plotting curves and calculations, sounddevice for data transmission and numpy to create the sinusoidal signal.
